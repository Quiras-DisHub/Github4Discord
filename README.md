Thank you for taking the time to read this.
I'd like to take full credit for all of the work here, but this has been
a joint project. I have gotten help from so many people on this that I have
lost count. I should have kept note of everyone so I am sorry that I don't
have all your names. But none the less Thank You, this project is as much 
yours as it is mine. We have all made this reality together.

This is a program ment to mimic the iconic computer scene in the movie "War
Games" This is broken down into individual python scripts so I can easily
edit things across the entire program.

retroInterface.py
	Is the primary program.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
chatbot.py
	Is a program that will be ran by retroInterface to simulate a chat
program. It will be added to and developed as I ge it done.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
checkers.py
 &
chess.py
 &
connectFour.py
 &
tictactoe.py
 &
gtw.py
	These are all games that you can play within the retroInterface.
Chess, Checkers and connectFour have not been made yet. Once made I will
add them in so stay tuned for updates.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
downloadBar.py
 &
tts.py
	These are both system scripts that simulate file downloads and text
to speech within the retroInterface.
